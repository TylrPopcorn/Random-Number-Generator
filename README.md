# Random-Number-Generator
A simple application that will generate a random number between 1 and 100 when a button is clicked on.

-----
Utilized the use of HTML, React, JavaScript, and CSS to design a user-friendly random number generator. The HTML provided the structural foundation of the application, defining the layout and components. React, a JavaScript library, facilitated the creation of dynamic and interactive elements, enabling seamless updates to the UI based on user inputs. JavaScript was employed to handle the logic behind generating random numbers and updating the display accordingly. Finally, CSS was instrumental in styling the app, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Together, these technologies allowed me to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing random number generator, enhancing my skills in web development.
